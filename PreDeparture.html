                    <h1>Pre-Departure</h1>
                    <p>I am currently one month into my year in Spain. For those of you unfamiliar with the particulars of my trip, I will be studying in Madrid at Universidad Carlos III (UC3M) for the Spring 2016 semester (January - May 2016). Following this, I will move over to Barcelona and begin an internship at Hewlett-Packard for the Summer and Fall 2016 semesters (June - December 2016). Obviously, I am a little late in getting this blog started, but I will try to catch up and write about my past month in Europe quickly. I will also include any and all photos I was able to take during my time. I would like to say a few words in this initial post about my preparation for this experience and the days leading up to my trip.</p>
                    <p>The first step in getting to Spain was to apply for a visa. This mostly went off smoothly barring a hiccup or two. That hiccup being the fact that I applied for a six month visa initially only to hear back from HP about getting the internship. While this was great news, I then had to reapply for a year long visa. It was an inconvenience that meant a 5 AM departure for chicago on a weekday, but otherwise wasn't a huge problem.</p> 
                    <p>So I got a visa (or two). And was ready to head to Spain. I had already done the application for UC3M and gotten accepted, so I was all set on that front. Really, the only thing standing between me and Spain was a week of finals, a duffel bag's worth of packing, and time. I was ready. My final few weeks at home during the holidays were spent with family and friends doing nothing in particular.</p>    
                    <p>I set a departure date for January 1st at 11:45 am. I decided to take the scenic route to Spain when my friends (Alden, Tommy, Kristy, and Christine) and I chose to take a 10-day-long trip that would take us to London, Paris, Geneva, and Marseille before landing us in Spain. I honestly felt no anxiety leading up to the trip, and that can probably be traced to blinding excitement and youthful exuberance.</p>     
                    <p>I spent a good holiday with family and friends and really tried to make good use of what little time I had left at home. I spent a lot of time catching up with high school friends and visiting family. I was so busy trying to see everyone before I left that I continued to put off packing until the day before. Packing was a bit of an adventure but certainly made easier by the fact that I decide to only take what I could carry onto the airplane. So I spent the New Year with friends and family, slept a few hours (this was by design, part of a half-baked plan to avoid jet lag), and left early on the first to catch my flight to London. Spending New Year's Day on a commute across the Atlantic wasn't ideal, but I was excited to get started.</p>
                    <p>Below are a few photos; two of me with my cousins during the holidays and a photo of my luggage. </p>

                    <p>P.S. My plan to avoid jet lag by staying up late did <strong>not</strong> work.</p>
