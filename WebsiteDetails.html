                    <h1>Website Details</h1>
                    <p>I would like to talk with a bit more detail about the motivation behind and the creation of this website. As I touched on in my earlier post, Hello, World! (LINK IT), I decided to create this website because I wanted to know how to do it. I felt, as a computer engineer, this was a skill that I should have. So, I decided to learn, used various resources to help me along the way, and started from scratch.</p>
                    <p>I used a couple different resources, each useful in its own way. I will talk a little bit about each of these: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first thing I did was use <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a> to learn html and CSS. Code Academy is probably the most popular source for learning basic coding languages. It helped me learn the basic html5 structures and tags as well as CSS styling. </li>
                        <li>After learning the basics of both html and CSS, I began to dive a little deeper into the specific tags, structures, and stylings used in basic web design. For this, I found an excellent Youtube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVTlvUkGslCV_h-nSAId8Sw">LearnCode.academy</a> with information ranging from basic web design to advanced web development tools. This series helped me to learn the largest portion of the skills required to create this website.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After learning the skills required to make a layout, I started in on the basic site structure. Once I created that, I had something that very much resembled this final product that you are viewing now. Once I finally got the aesthetics to look the way I wanted, I tried to add some extra functionality. The first thing I decide to do was make the layout responsive (allowing for the site to adjust to whatever screen/window size the user chooses). To do this, I utilized <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. For those unfamiliar, Bootstrap is a framework that has many predefined CSS rules to allow for easily integrating features into a website. One of the main Bootstrap features that I used was the grid layout system. Bootstrap automatically divides the screen into 12 separate columns no matter the screen size. This allows the developer to add elements that are a certain number of columns across so that the elements adjust as the screen size changes. This is an incredible tool that I would definitely recommend to any of you looking to get into web development.</p>
                    <p>Those are really all the essentials I used. Obviously, there is huge room for improvement, and I intend to continue to improve it as I learn and add content to the site. I will continue to add updates to this page if I make any major changes in the future.</p>
