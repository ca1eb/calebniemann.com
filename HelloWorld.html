                    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
                    <p>I made this website simply because I wanted to know how to. I wrote the skeleton and base styling in HTML/CSS with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. Bootstrap uses a grid layout system that was extremely useful in making the sidebar. It will also allow me to make the site active; meaning that it will change according to the window/screen size of the browser/device you are viewing it through. I purchased the domain and hosting services at <a href="http://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator</a>. I will write about the process in a bit more detail in another post.</p>
                    <p>Initially, I'm not sure the direction I want to take with this site. I guess since I am currently one month into my yearlong stay in Spain, a travel blog of sorts would be appropriate. Aside from that, I would like to include some of my projects, both inside and outside of the classroom, that I am proud of. As for the structure of the website itself, I will (for now) have four main pages. These pages will each have blog style postings about anything I deem interesting enough to share. These pages will be as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The home page. This page will be general thoughts as well as website updates like the one you are reading now.</li>
                        <li>The <a href="student.html">'Student'</a> page. This page will include information and updates regarding school, namely: projects, coding homework, etc. </li>
                        <li>The <a href="traveler.html">'Traveler'</a> page. This will be the travel blog with updates about my time in Spain. I hope to update this one quite often when I do something cool, but I can't make any promises.</li>
                        <li>The <a href="engineer.html">'Engineer'</a> page. This page will include some posts about projects and other professional activities that I participate in outside of the classroom. Here I will talk more about the process of making this website, other projects, and interesting experiences I have had/will have at work. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For now, that is it. I will continue to update website functionality as there are many things that I would like to add, but the brunt of the time I will spend from this moment forward will be writing and adding content. Thanks for taking the time to read. Cheers!</p>
