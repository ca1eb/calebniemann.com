    We arrived in Geneva at a reasonable time on the 5th, and once we got to our hostel, Geneva Hostel(LINK IT), we went off to explore the city a bit and grab some food. The city is incredibly clean, and it has a ton of nice stores, restaurants, and interesting sights to see. After dinner, we walked around by Lake Geneva(LAKE?) and watched some swans that were trying to dive for some dinner of their own. When we were done exploring for the night, we went back to the hostel to get some sleep. 
    The next day, the group went for a tour of CERN early in the morning that I neglected to sign up for in time, so I was left to explore the city on my own a bit. I decided to just take a stroll through the city. I ended up back at Lake Geneva(LAKE?) and saw the man made geyser(WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS THING?) up close. It was quite a beautiful sight. I also stumbled upon a cathedral that was quite beautiful. It had wonderful stained glass windows and large columns. Afterwards, I went back to meet up with the crew who had finished their tour, and we went to the next destination: the United Nations. 
    We were lucky enough to get to tour the United Nations Headquarter(FACT CHECK - HEART?). It was an interesting tour, and we were able to see many of the conference rooms that the UN holds hearings and meetings in. After seeing many of the facilities, we went to an older wing that still showed signs of its time being the headquarters for the failed League of Nations: emblems on doors, plaqes, and so on. It was amazing getting to see a place where so much history has taken place, and evem more amazing that it has such worldwide impact to this day. It was definitely a great way to round out our trip. After our tour, we gathered our things and went to catch our train to Marseille, France.
