                    <h1>European Adventure: London</h1>
                    <p>I arrived in London on the 2nd of January at around 7 AM. After an uneventful run in with customs, I was on my way to meet my friends at the <a href="https://www.restup.co.uk/">RestUp London</a>, the hostel we were staying in. I didn't have internet on my phone, but I looked up the directions from the airport to the hostel before I left the states and wrote it down. A short(ish) commute on the metro and a 5 minute walk put me at the hostel. I checked in and had just enough time to toss my stuff into my bed before turning around and heading out for a day of sightseeing. Tommy, Alden, Kristy, and Christine had been in London for a day already, so they already had a plan in place. I was groggy and jet lagged from a late New Year's Eve and 12 hour flight, so it was just as well that I didn't have to make any decisions. </p>
                    <p>We only had a day and a half left before taking the Chunnel to Paris, so we didn't waste any time in getting to our first destination. We arrived at the London Museum of Science. I am pretty sure that the museum was quite interesting, but it is a bit tough for me to be certain. I was able to see very little of it before jet lag sank in. We had just ventured through an antique timekeeping exhibit (AKA clocks; much more interesting than it sounds) when I started to feel it. Anytime the group stopped to check out anything, I immediately looked for a seat. All told, I took upwards of double digit naps throughout the Museum of Science. It may have been optimistic thinking I could just skip jet lag, but at least I was able to see some clocks before it hit me. At one point (I'm told) I became an exhibit myself as multiple tourists took photos of me sleeping on a bench. Safe to say, I was killing it in London thus far.</p>
                    <p>After my napping exploits, I was actually feeling alright as we left the museum to grab some lunch. Nothing like a revitalizing public nap (or ten) to get the juices flowing. After some chicken curry and a short walk, Tommy and I decided to head to a pub to watch the Arsenal vs. Newcastle United match while Alden, Kristy, and Christine wanted to go see the London Bridge. After a quick internet search, we found a bar called the Maple Leaf that supposedly played matches, and away we went. The plan was for the others to meet up with us at the Maple Leaf when they were finished seeing the bridge, so when we got to the pub and saw that they weren't playing the match, we were stuck there watching rugby (admittedly, pretty entertaining) and waiting for our friends. It was fun none the less. So after a failed attempt to watch Premier League football in London, we went back to the hostel to get ready for dinner. For dinner, we went to SOHO and afterwards made our way to a nightclub. When all was said and done, I crawled into bed at 3 AM after arriving 23 hours earlier at 6. I slept well.</p>
                    <p>The next day, our train left in the evening, so we tried to pack a lot into the day. We left early for the Tower of London. In route, we passed over the London Bridge. It was Tommy and I's first sighting of the bridge, and it was quite beautiful. The weather wasn't the best compliment to the giant structure, but it was impressive despite the wind and rain. We walked across the bridge and got our first real glimpse of the Tower of London about halfway across. It was an interesting structure to see, but the architecture wasn't the most interesting part. The contents of the compound include wall engravings from prisoners held in the 1500s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravens_of_the_Tower_of_London">ravens</a> whose existence is aparrantly the only thing standing between the royal kingdom and destruction, and the crown jewels. Once we had explored each of these thoroughly, we moved on to our final stop in London: the British Museum.</p>
                    <p>The British Museum is incredible. You could easily spend an entire week wandering around and not see everything there is to see. Once inside, Tommy and I decided to take it slow and just kind of aimlessly wander while Alden, Kristy, and Christine had a specific list of sights they wanted to see. Tommy and I found ourselves in the ancient Egyptian section of the museum and saw, among other things, a 5500 year old body that was incredibly well preserved. Next, we ventured into the Buddhist and Hindu section of the museum and were surrounded by obscenely intricate statues, carvings, molding, and other artwork. As we were running out of time, we decided to make one last stop in the "Enlightenment" exhibit. This included statues, other artwork, scrolls, and books from the Enlightenment period. We also got to see the mummified remains of a <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/scanning_sobek.aspx">crocodile god</a> on the way out, and that was as interesting as it was surprising. I hated to leave the museum (and London) after seeing so little of what it had to offer, but our train was leaving shortly, so we had to move on to the next phase of our journey: Paris.</p>
